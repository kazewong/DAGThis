# DAGThis

This library do one thing and one thing only: given a directory, scan all the files underneath recursively to search for predefined marco entry points, then building a Directed acyclic graph (DAG) to describe the dependencies structure of the entry points.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Basic graph structure
- [ ] 
- [ ] Plain text scanning
- [ ] Programmatically add nodes and edges to the graph
